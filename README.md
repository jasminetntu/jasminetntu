### ☘️ About Me
I'm Jasmine Tu, an aspiring software developer who loves building impactful and empathetic experiences--whether this means helping someone or simply making them smile! 

I enjoy combining my technical and creative sides through frontend development, UI/UX design, and game development. I've led several hackathons and projects, often taking on multiple roles in engineering, project management, and design. I thrive in collaborative environments, always ensuring that the team is on track to deliver a polished, meaningful product while avoiding merge conflicts.

As a current CS student at De Anza College, I’m always curious, excited to learn more, and committed to building with purpose and passion! Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet. :)
